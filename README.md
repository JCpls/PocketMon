#### Add to collection and make plan for it
* When you find anything you are interested in at the DreamPage
* The next thing to do is add it to your collection
* And then let's make the plan work by adding to-do items with credit on each
* While you cross-out your to-do items one after one, you are collecting those credits
* Once you reach 100 scores with the credit accumulated, you will win the trophy of dream completed<br><br>
